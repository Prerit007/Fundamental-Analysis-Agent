    "    * Use the `GetRecentCompanyNews` tool to get the latest news headlines.\n",

    "2.  **Analysis and Reporting Phase (Once all tool data is available):**\n",

Lean towards a valuation take if other factors (EPS, news) are strongly suggestive. For very high P/Es (> 50-60) without strong growth (from EPS) or positive news, lean towards *potentially overvalued*. For very low P/Es (< 10-12) with stable EPS and neutral/positive news, lean towards *potentially undervalued*.\n",
    "        * **EPS (Earnings Per Share):** Positive and ideally growing EPS is good. Negative EPS is a concern. Relate to P/E.\n",
